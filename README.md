Table creation with random 30 rows for testing
```sql

CREATE TABLE item (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    price NUMBER,
    total_number NUMBER,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Insert 30 random records
INSERT INTO item (name, price, total_number)
SELECT
    'Item_' || LEVEL AS name,
    TRUNC(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(10, 500)) AS price,
    TRUNC(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(1, 100)) AS total_number
FROM dual
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 30;

SELECT * FROM item;
